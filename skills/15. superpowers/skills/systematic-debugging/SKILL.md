# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, bugs in production, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits

4. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples** — locate similar working code
2. **Compare Against References** — read reference implementation COMPLETELY
3. **Identify Differences** — list every difference, however small
4. **Understand Dependencies** — what settings, config, environment?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis** — "I think X is the root cause because Y"
2. **Test Minimally** — make the SMALLEST possible change: one variable at a time
3. **Verify Before Continuing** — did it work? Yes → Phase 4; No → form NEW hypothesis
4. **When You Don't Know** — say "I don't understand X", don't pretend to know

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case** — MUST have before fixing (use `test-driven-development` skill)
2. **Implement Single Fix** — address the root cause, ONE change at a time
3. **Verify Fix** — test passes? Other tests unbroken?
4. **If 3+ Fixes Failed** — STOP and question the architecture

## Red Flags — STOP and Follow Process

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## Real-World Impact

- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
